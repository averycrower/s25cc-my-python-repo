# Creative Coding : Python 
This repository is where I store my projects made in creative coding python class of spring 2025.

## What I am learning in this class
- Data visualization
- Live Coding
- Python Drawing

## Resources
As I just started learning python from this class, I do not have a list of resources that I currently use. However, I forsee myself using resources such as:
- My peers
- The class GitHub page with links such as "Learn Git" and "git cheat sheet" 
- I will also outsource AI tools to assist with explaining concepts, facts and code, as well as to assist me in finding other resources. I think AI could be really useful in pointing out mistakes within the code and how to fix it.

## Technology Vulnerability Index
Here is access to an Index I made to support my thesis research regarding digital infrastructure and the vulnerabilities it creates for certain communities. This research helped me understand what communities are apart of the digital divide.
